## What I would change

- Styling: I think the current style is concise and clean but it is missing something 'Italian'. The orange-red ish color means pepperoni of course.
- Package Verions: I forked the Next.JS & TailWindCSS from a CodeSandBox. The verion of React and TailWindCSS is quite old and may missing some features.
